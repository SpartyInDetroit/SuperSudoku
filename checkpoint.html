<h1>Project 1 Checkpoint</h1>
<p>Please indicate your team members and the task assignment for each member:</p>
<p>Carl Johnson, Ryan Switzer, Vinny Sabatini&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>List all of the classes you expect your project to require and a brief description of the purpose of the class:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cell – There will be two types of this, one will contain the data for the cell, the answer, guess, and hints/notes.
    The other will be just a number to display so the user can not change the value.  The second type is just for initializing the board.</p>
<p>Board – This will be the current game board</p>
<p>Solution – This will contain the 10 possible board solutions</p>
<p>View – Displays the board</p>
<p>Controller – Take in the input and make decisions</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indicate how you will encode a sample puzzle as PHP. Remember, that you need to encode not only how the puzzle will appear to the user, but the solution as well.</p>
<p>There will be two boards, the Solution board and the Game board.  Both boards will be an array of 9 arrays, creating a 9x9 board.
    There will be two types of elements in the arrays, one being a cell which will have the answer, the user’s guess, and an
    array of 9 possible notes so the user can keep track of possible solutions in the cell.  The other will be just a number.
    This distinction is made because when the game is initialized, the starting board is not allowed to be changed.
    When the new game is created, the Solution board will fill in the answer for each cell of the Game board to check the final answer. &nbsp;</p>
